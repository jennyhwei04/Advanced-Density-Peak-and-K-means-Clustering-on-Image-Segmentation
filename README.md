# Advanced-Density-Peak-and-K-means-Clustering-on-Image-Segmentation
Abstract—K-means is a classical and widely-used data clustering
algorithm. Despite its effectiveness, the drawbacks are
obvious that it needs to know k value previously and not suitable
for complex situations. Density Peak clustering can practice on
irregular data sets with a higher accuracy and better performance
than K-means and doesn’t need to get prior knowledge. However,
few concentrated on their performances on image segmentation. In
this paper, we propose novel image segmentation approaches based
on K-means and Density Peak clustering which greatly reduce
running time. Compared with current methods, our methods
have improved aspects as following: 1) The methods could have
much shorter run time performance than other current normal
methods. 2) Unlike other current image segmentation methods,
our method could save the original colors of the pictures and
provide a rather real image segments. Experiments on test data
will testify the validity of the methods and a detailed description
based on empirical results will be provided as conclusions.
